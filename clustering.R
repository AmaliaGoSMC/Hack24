# Risk Clustering: Highlighting interdependent risks prone to cascading failures.


#  calculate clusters of risks --------------------------------------------

# Count co-occurrences of risk categories within the same Project_ID
risk_co_occurrence <- data_cleaned %>%
    select(project_id, main_risk_cat) %>%
    distinct() %>% # Avoid double-counting the same risk in the same project
    count(main_risk_cat, project_id) %>%
    spread(key = main_risk_cat, value = n, fill = 0)

# Convert to a co-occurrence matrix (Risk Category x Risk Category)
co_occ_matrix <- as.matrix(risk_co_occurrence[,-1]) # Remove Project_ID column
co_occ_matrix <- t(co_occ_matrix) %*% co_occ_matrix # Compute co-occurrences
    

# Perform hierarchical clustering
risk_dist <- dist(co_occ_matrix, method = "euclidean")
risk_hclust <- hclust(risk_dist, method = "ward.D")

# Plot dendrogram to visualize risk dependencies
plot(risk_hclust, labels = colnames(co_occ_matrix), main = "Risk Co-Occurrence Clustering")

# Assign risk categories to clusters
num_clusters <- 4 # Choose based on the dendrogram structure
risk_clusters <- cutree(risk_hclust, k = num_clusters)

# View cluster assignments
risk_cluster_map <- tibble(Risk_Category = names(risk_clusters), Cluster = risk_clusters)
print(risk_cluster_map)

# This dendrogram shows how different Risk Categories are grouped based on their co-occurrence patterns within projects. It helps identify interdependent risks that are more likely to cascade.
# 
# Key Takeaways from Your Dendrogram
# 
# 1. Hierarchical Structure
# 
# Risks closer together on the tree are more likely to co-occur in projects.
# 
# Risks merged at lower heights (shorter branches) are highly interdependent.
# 
# Risks merged at higher heights are less related but still share some co-occurrence.

# Comments for Rosa to add to narrative
# ðŸ”´ Cluster 1: Strategic & Technical Risks
# 
# These risks affect the overall direction and technical success of a project. If they go wrong, the project could fail due to poor planning, integration issues, or legal complications.
# ðŸ“Œ Includes:
#     
#     Business Strategy & Objectives â†’ Poor planning, unclear goals, shifting priorities.
# 
# System Integration, Verification & Validation â†’ Failures when combining different systems.
# 
# Contractual/Legal â†’ Legal disputes, compliance failures, contract breaches.
# 
# Hardware/Software Development â†’ Problems in building or coding technology.
# 
# 
# ðŸ›‘ Why Itâ€™s Risky:
#     If you donâ€™t get these right at the start, your project may never be completed successfully.
# 
# 
#     
#     ðŸŸ  Cluster 2: Supply Chain & Management Risks
# 
# These risks involve managing resources, logistics, and supplies. If things go wrong, the project might face delays, shortages, or extra costs.
# ðŸ“Œ Includes:
#     
#     Supply Chain â†’ Delivery failures, missing parts, supplier issues.
# 
# Project Management â†’ Poor leadership, bad coordination, missed deadlines.
# 
# 
# ðŸ›‘ Why Itâ€™s Risky:
#     Even if everything else is perfect, a project can fail if it lacks resources or isnâ€™t managed well.
# 
# 
#     
#     ðŸŸ¡ Cluster 3: Financial & Operational Risks
# 
# These risks impact how money, customers, and operations are handled. If they go wrong, the project may become too expensive or fail to meet expectations.
# ðŸ“Œ Includes:
#     
#     Acquisition and Offsets â†’ Buying the wrong resources or bad trade-offs.
# 
# Logistic Support & Services â†’ Problems with maintenance, staffing, and day-to-day operations.
# 
# Other Risks & Contingencies â†’ Unexpected problems affecting operations.
# 
# Customers â†’ Issues with meeting client needs or losing customers.
# 
# Finance â†’ Budget overruns, financial mismanagement.
# 
# System Engineering â†’ Complex technical failures.
# 
# 
# ðŸ›‘ Why Itâ€™s Risky:
#     Even well-managed projects can collapse due to financial issues or operational failures.
# 
# 
# ---
#     
#     ðŸŸ¢ Cluster 4: Business & Bidding Risks
# 
# These risks affect the business side of the projectâ€”whether it wins funding, secures contracts, or stays competitive.
# ðŸ“Œ Includes:
#     
#     Bid Management â†’ Losing funding or contracts.
# 
# 
# ðŸ›‘ Why Itâ€™s Risky:
#     A project can fail before it even starts if it doesnâ€™t win bids or funding.
# 
# 
#     
#     ðŸ“¢ Final Takeaway
# 
# If Cluster 1 risks are high â†’ The whole project strategy and technical execution is at risk.
# 
# If Cluster 2 risks are high â†’ The project may struggle with delays and poor coordination.
# 
# If Cluster 3 risks are high â†’ The project may suffer from financial issues or operational failures.
# 
# If Cluster 4 risks are high â†’ The project may not even get off the ground due to lost bids or funding.
